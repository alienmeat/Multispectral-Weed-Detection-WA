This project is related to 'Leveraging Remote Sensing and Deep Learning for Weed Detection: A Case Study in Multispectral Dataset Construction in Western Australia'.

## Summary

The Kondinin region in Western Australia faces significant agricultural challenges due to widespread weed infestations, resulting in considerable economic losses and ecological impacts.  To address these issues, this study focuses on constructing a customized multispectral remote sensing dataset to enhance precision agriculture practices.  Utilizing UAV technology, we collected raw multispectral data from the E2 and E8 experimental areas, covering 0.6046 km², from 2020 to 2023.  This data underwent extensive preprocessing, including denoising, radiometric calibration, image alignment, orthorectification, and image stitching, to create a high-resolution, labeled multispectral image dataset tailored to the region's unique geographical conditions. We selected vegetation indices—NDVI, GNDVI, EVI, SAVI, and MSAVI—as classification features and employed deep learning models to identify weeds, thereby validating the dataset's effectiveness in practical applications and it was used as a benchmark for weed detection in this area. This innovative dataset and methodology establish a robust foundation for future precision agriculture research in Western Australia and provide a valuable benchmark for advancing remote sensing applications in agriculture.
